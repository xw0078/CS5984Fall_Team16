      "Research related to teacher induction programs is reviewed, considering their background, need, purpose, design, and outcomes. Likewise, mentoring and coaching programs are reviewed, and their roles in an induction program. There has been a rapid growth in teacher induction programs, up from 40 in the early 1990s to over 80 in 2006. Induction programs across the country vary in quality, but the literature suggests that teaching is such an extreme challenge that any assistance is helpful. Studies show that induction programs contribute to improvements in teacher quality and retention, and give school districts a positive return on investment. Mentorship programs help build supportive relationships between senior and junior teachers, which is believed to contribute to increased retention and professional commitment. Instructional coaching yields high teacher satisfaction and improvements in teaching practices. Mentorship programs and instructional coaching both can help teachers to feel less isolated, which is a leading cause of teacher attrition.\n",

Mentorship helped novice teachers learn the practical things not taught in college, and the everyday operations of a teacher. While mentorship is focused on teacher wellbeing and support, instructional coaching aims at student support and their academic success. Novice teachers indicated feelings of overwhelming isolation. They expressed feeling emotionally supported by their mentors, which helped to fight the feeling of isolation. The subjects’ reported perceptions of instructional coaching were also positive.

      "The study’s findings -- on mentoring and instructional coaching program components, that novice teachers need emotional support followed by academic and instructional guidance, and the roles of mentors and instructional coaches regarding emotional and academic support -- indicate that the induction programs were very similar to what was described in the reviewed literature. It corroborates prior work in reporting novice teachers’ feelings of isolation and the stress teachers feel due to the emphasis on testing. The findings show that support first needed to come in the form of emotional support and relationships building through mentorship in order for instructional coaching to be effective. This study provides new insight into how mentor programs and instructional coaching best work together, one providing emotional support while the other provides instructional support. Further research is needed to examine what happens after the induction period concludes, if these findings are also applicable to secondary school teachers, and if aspects of induction programs could be employed as part of university curriculum. Overall, this study found that having an induction program that includes both mentoring and instructional coaching can help school districts retain new teachers. Further work could enhance the consistency of mentoring programs, and ensure balance in the level of support provided.\n",

      "The Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis Mulsant, is an aboveground chewing pest of many commercially grown legumes such as common beans, lima beans, tepary beans, soybeans, alfalfa, beggarweed, and cowpea. Regarding geographical distribution, they are native to western Mexico and Central America, they range over most of the USA and southern Canada, especially in the Mid-Atlantic and Appalachian Mountain regions. Their life cycle (pupa, larva, egg, and adult) proceeds within the canopy of host plants, feeding primarily on leaves and secondarily on pods. Adults have a round body shape, concealed head, and black dorsal spots. Regarding colonization of host plants as well as the susceptibility and resistance among host plants, both thrive similarly as temperature and rainfall vary; overwintered adults can fly long distances to find host plants. Various management techniques have been tried, such as cultural, physical/mechanical, chemical and biological; success had come mostly from resistant crops, reflective plastic mulch, the eulophid wasp, Pediobius foveolatus, and chemical controls. The native range and spread of the beetle, fluctuations in pest status, and cause for pest decline indicate that climate change as well as interventions have reduced the threat, but it still is serious. Research objectives cover study related to the beetle, planting snap beans on a highly reflective mulch, and growing snap beans from thiamethoxam-treated seeds.\n",

      "The effect of Mexican bean beetle on three types of snap beans, three lima bean cultivars, and one soybean cultivar was evaluated experimentally, considering their susceptibility to the beetle. Most susceptible was the purple wax snap bean, Dragon’s Tongue; avoiding planting susceptible cultivars or applying management methods should be considered. Susceptibility decreased from snap beans to lima beans to soybeans. The small-plot field experiments conducted 2013-2016 at Virginia Tech’s Kentland Research Farm examined Mexican bean beetle attraction, developmental success, and injury potential to popular snap bean and lima bean cultivars; mark-release-recapture experiments also proceeded there. Greenhouse experiments examined the developmental success of beetle larvae in a controlled setting. JMP was used to analyze the data, which showed a significant effect from the choice of cultivar. Mark-release-capture studies helped when focussing on biological factors; field cage plot experiments yielded the highest number of recaptures.\n",

      "Mexican bean beetles are intolerant to direct sunlight and are typically found on the undersides of leaves. Plastic mulch is commonly used for weed control and controlling soil temperature and evaporation. Highly reflective mulches (e.g., with aluminum or silver) have been used to mitigate injury and disease transmission from various insects. Small scale experiments in 2014 and 2015 at Virginia Tech’s Kentland Farm tested if Dragon’s Tongue snap beans grown on metallized, highly reflective, agricultural polyethylene would have fewer Mexican bean beetles and less injury than those grown on black plastic or bare soil, due to the higher reflected light intensity. Significant reductions in Mexican bean beetle densities and feeding injury were observed in both metalized and white plastic plots compared to black plastic and bare soil. Results suggest that growing snap beans on reflective plastic mulch can suppress the incidence and damage of Mexican bean beetle, and increase yield in snap beans, two times that from white or black plastic, and five times greater than bare soil.\n",

      "The neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, is commonly applied, perhaps over used, as a seed-coating (seed-treatment) to commercial snap beans. Previous studies highlight the efficacy of this seed-treatment in snap beans, however, none have been conducted in agroecosystems where the predominating pest is the Mexican bean beetle. The goal of experiments 2013-2016 at Virginia Tech’s Kentland Farm was to quantify effects of growing snap beans from thiamethoxam-treated seed on Mexican bean beetle densities and feeding injury, toxicity to Podisus maculiventris (a common predator of the beetle), densities of other arthropods (herbivores and predators), and crop performance. Greenhouse assays showed roughly 90 fatal effects thirteen days after planting, with lower levels after, which led to reduced effect on beetle populations in 4 out of 5 field tests because of delays from seasonal and environmental differences. Though thiamethoxam-treated seeds can provide significant control of Mexican bean beetles and other pests of snap beans, the potential as well as limitations should be considered, along with other management approaches.\n",

      "Research starting in 2012 at Virginia Tech’s Kentland Farm began with observation, at all life-stages, of heavy Mexican bean beetle infestation of snap bean plants. The serious problems of the 1960s and 1970s in this regard were reduced for large-scale conventional growers, partly since their farms rarely overlapped with the range of the beetle, but there was severe impact in the Appalachian Mountains in non-chemical small to mid-sized farms, determined by surveying growers across the country. This led to a literature review, screening of cultivars for susceptibility to the beetles, and identification of Dragon’s Tongue as highly susceptible. While in snap beans the pest is relatively easy to control using one or two foliar applications of standard insecticides, and thiamethoxam seed-treatments can benefit growers within the range of the Mexican bean beetle, this beetle still poses a problem for organic growers. It was found that the novel management strategy of reflective plastic mulch was effective in reducing injury.  Growing a late-season double-crop like lettuce can leverage the expense of the plastic, and choosing other cultivars like Caprice together with a trap crop like Dragon’s Tongue, can be effective solutions to the beetle problem.\n",

      "Peanuts, which are a leguminous crop, are rich in calories and vital nutrients, vitamins, antioxidants, minerals. They have many health benefits. Being a staple food in Ghana, they are highly important for the region. Cancer-causing aflatoxins are secondary metabolites of some aspergillus fungi. Regulations on aflatoxins have been established, to protect humans and animals from their harmful effects. Aflatoxin-producing fungi need favorable temperature, relative humidity and grain moisture conditions to grow and produce toxins. Aflatoxin production can occur in the field prior to harvest also. Both pre and post-harvest aflatoxin contamination may cause losses of Grains. Post harvest peanut activities are conducive for aflatoxin development. Since storage is an important factor to combat the contamination, various storage solutions have been developed. Some of the storage solutions can pose challenges under Ghanaian conditions Chemical and bio-control can leave residues on peanuts during and after storage. Getting carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and other inert gases to displace oxygen under modified and controlled atmosphere can also be challenging. However, it can meet the goal of finding an appropriate, affordable, and adaptable storage system to help reduce or control aspergillus growth, aflatoxin production, and maintain the quality of peanuts. In addition, packages friendlier to the Ghanaian environment are hermetic storage and active packaging. The type of packaging used for storage can also reduce the rate of lipid oxidation and quality deterioration. \n",

      "Peanuts are used in most developing countries to prevent malnutrition, due to their high protein content. In most developing countries peanuts are infested with fungi, especially Aspergillus that produce aflatoxin. The effect of pre-storage treatments and packaging to control aflatoxin production and quality degradation during storage was studied. Partially roasting and blanching peanuts can increase the effectiveness of sorting, and hence aid in reducing aflatoxin along the peanut value-chain. Also, hermetically storing peanuts can suppress the growth of aflatoxigenic fungi and the production of aflatoxin under tropical ambient conditions. Raw clean peanuts can best maintain quality during storage but might still have high aflatoxin levels. Sorting could be a very good method for reducing aflatoxin levels before and during storage. However, hand-sorting consumes time and adds additional preparation cost. Partially roasting, and blanching peanuts, can kill the aflatoxigenic fungi and halt aflatoxin production during storage, and also increase the effectiveness of peanut sorting; thus aiding in reducing or eliminating aflatoxin levels along the peanut value chain. To have low levels of aflatoxin before, during, and after storage, as well as to maintain peanut quality, it would be best to partially roast peanuts, blanch them, sort out the infested and discolored ones, and then hermetically store the resulting set.\n",

      "In Ghana and in other countries Sub-Saharan Africa, aflatoxin fungi infestation causes the post-harvest loss in peanuts. Since polypropylene woven sacks are not airtight, peanuts stored in them are susceptible to fungal and aflatoxin contamination. Studies have shown that hermetic packs can be used effectively to suppress fungi growth, aflatoxin production and quality deterioration in stored peanuts. As the peanut business in Ghana is generally profitable, farmers and traders stand to make additional revenue and profits from switching from traditional packaging to hermetic storage. The study aims to determine if the new hermetic storage technology is more profitable than existing storage methods, before recommending it for peanut farmers and traders. While the new storage technology improves the farmer and trader profitability, it has the potential to reduce the incidence of various ailments that have been attributed to aflatoxins. Hence, the local production and marketing of a hermetic storage system should be encouraged, along with the active creation of awareness of their benefits in reducing the incidence of aflatoxins. In considering the significant national economic impacts of aflatoxins, peanut farmers and traders could be assisted through various financing schemes to acquire the new technology.\n",

      "The behavior of lambs in a conventional pasture system and hardwood silvopastures was documented with video (trail cameras for the entire subpaddock containing the lambs) and audio (microphone near the mouth). That was followed by time lapse and acoustic analysis, which involved manual labeling of 5 types of behavior, and spectral analysis of grazing. Results show that lambs preferred shade and actively search for it, spending over 90 of daylight hours in shade. Lambs spent more time lying down in the silvopastures, where they were more comfortable, and more time standing up in the open pastures. From the acoustic analysis, no significant differences were found in daily bite counts and bite count by time of day. Ambient conditions in the silvopastures were more favorable for grazing than in the open pastures; grazing in the black walnut silvopastures was more frequent than in other settings. However, an increased heat tolerance of the lambs may minimize the difference in grazing behavior between lambs in silvopastures and open pastures.\n",

The lambs in the honeylocust silvopastures had similar vaginal temperatures as to lambs in the open pastures, perhaps due to declining shade cover.

      "A national problem of preparing students for a contemporary society, widely recognized through landmark reports in the 1980’s, was confirmed to still exist within the educational system of the United States. Evidence was provided to show that a deficit of STEM literacy has led to a widening gap between scientific and technological developers and average citizens, a threat to global competitiveness, and inability to maintain a future STEM-capable workforce. Though a natural resource of future leaders and innovators, gifted students are often largely ignored in all-inclusive classrooms; the No Child Left Behind initiative has been particularly detrimental to the gifted student population. To maximize the learning experiences of these gifted students, accelerated and differentiated programs that focus on STEM disciplines have been recognized as a viable solution for the national problem. Though ranging in various frameworks,these programs have a higher rate of students graduating with STEM degrees compared to the national average. The Virginia Governor’s Schools provide gifted services, through academic and visual and performing arts opportunities, to approximately 6,500 students in Virginia with many schools promoting a STEM-focused curriculum; 17 of the 19 Academic-Year Governor’s Schools have a STEM focus. The evaluation procedures of these programs were recognized to play an important role in providing evidence to the effectiveness of these programs, thus leading to one solution to the national problem.\n",

Descriptive and content analyses were completed to inform Research Questions 1 (on collective proficiency levels) and 2  (on emergent theses and recommendations). Evaluators were recruited to participate in the study and interviewed on their interpretations of best practices for AYGS program standards, thus informing research question 3 (on interpretations of evaluators) and six sub-research questions (on how evaluators recognize various types of best practices). Strategies embedded within the study were designed to establish truthfulness, credibility, dependability, and transferability into the study. A pilot study, carried out with one evaluator, aimed to ensure the clarity of the 50 semi-structured interview questions. The analysis included descriptive, content, and thematic aspects. The researcher, a high school science teacher in a Virginia Governor’s school for the last five years, holding a proactive stance intending to promote the Virginia Governor’s Schools, hence chose evaluation to obtain sound evidence.\n",

      "The research questions that directed this study were based upon concerns from stakeholders that the 2014 Governor’s School Full-Site Evaluation rubric was an untested instrument that was leading to modifications of programming within the Governor’s Schools. The inclusive results of rubric implementation have identified general areas of strengths and weaknesses in program curriculum, professional development, program design, guidance and counseling, identification and selection processes, and facilities amongst the five schools. Evaluators who have used the instrument have similar perceptions and expectations of how AYGS faculty should implement best practices. The conclusion of this study is not to assess the effectiveness of the instrument, but condense major findings to inform evaluation designers of consequential evidence. Major findings of the study are highlighted as follows: (a) the instrument supports the development of the gifted student as an individual; (b) the instrument supports faculty that are committed to building positive relationships, scholarship, and pursuing professional development; (c) the instrument supports developing STEM-capable students through scientific exploration and civic involvement; and (d) the instrument contains constructs of importance, relevance, and usefulness. Evaluators were positive in their impressions of the AYGS evaluation procedures and welcomed opportunities to observe the spectrum of strategies implemented to deliver gifted services. The perceptions of best practices were analogous amongst participants and observed incidences of best practices manifested in diverse ways. Recommendations are for rubric designers to restructure the rubric to undergo a psychometric assessment and/or ensure the language is evaluative instead of descriptive, modify standards to increase relevancy (e.g. student identification), provide definitions for rubric terminology, and specify what evidence of program actions are to be sought to ensure quality programming.\n",

Women’s leadership styles are different from men but include positive characteristics like inclusiveness, empathy, effective communication up and down the hierarchy, and broader focus. The majority of those in administrative training programs are women, yet few end up as superintendent. The purpose of this study, in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina is to examine different factors affecting female superintendents. Among the questions pursued are what is the relationship of job satisfaction with role conflict and role commitment. The hypothesis is that women having greater internal role conflict about balancing home and work roles will be less satisfied with their position as compared to those having greater role commitment (in home and work). This study should be worth noting by policymakers and aspirants. \n",

In doing so, three themes emerged—1) Affirming Issues, 2) Clarifying Misconstructions, and 3) Leadership Practices of Female Superintendents. While affirming the fact that women should not simply be hired due to their gender, some of the research calls for tearing down a system that can subdue female leaders or aspiring leaders. As an alternative, educators, and particularly educational leaders should be identifying a problem and creatively finding ways to adapt, resulting in a tangible, meaningful, and reasonable solution.

      "Parallel programming is becoming ubiquitous with an increasing number of cores. Using multithreading, a performance speedup can be experienced due to concurrent execution of threads. Educators’ efforts to improve curriculum related to threads can benefit from a special debugging tool to make it easier to program threads, that helps students to better understand bugs and provides a high level description relating to their cause. Past students had expressed difficulty working on fork-join framework; their feedback is a driving factor of the research. Existing debugging tools, such as Helgrind, focus strictly on data-races. They do not identify and describe the high-level root cause of bugs. Willgrind is a special-purpose debugging tool, that is built from scratch using the Valgrind framework, can directly detect bugs and provide high-level descriptions about their cause. WillgrindPlus is a tool that indicate if the student program is vulnerable to a bug that can manifest itself in a different execution. Both Willgrind and WillgrindPlus provide output through an interactive web interface. A user study was performed on Virginia Tech students to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of tools.

      "In divide and conquer algorithms,  a problem is divided into many independent subproblems. These subproblems can be solved independently using a multithreading framework. The fork-join framework, such as for Java (with constructs like future, submit, get, and free) is efficient, simple, and provides regularity. It is taught through programming projects in computer science courses at Virginia Tech. If some threads become idle while others are working, that can reduce the performance of the framework. A work stealing strategy can be used to rectify this problem. To catch bugs, static and dynamic program analysis can be done. Since static program analysis can not catch runtime bugs, it is limited. Valgrind, a dynamic binary instrumentation framework, disassembles the client binary into an intermediate representation, instruments it, and reassembles into machine code using dynamic binary. Valgrind runs as a single thread and the execution of client threads is serialized with, each thread being correctly abstracted and registered with the kernel.\n",

      "WilgrindPlus extends Wilgrind, also providing happens before based checking. It does not include semantic violations and deadlock. Happens-before violations indicate a latent failure in the execution. Willgrind has to be run several times to detect a bug; it does nothing when a bug is hidden by the scheduling, limiting its detection by the scheduler. WelgrindPlus rectifies this problem and leverages happens-before based checking to augment detection. Students only need to run the tool a minimal number of times to detect dormant bugs. Vector clocks, each assigned to a process, are used to check happens-before relationships of model future state transitions, ensuring proper thread synchronization exists between the state transitions. Each model future state transition is assigned a vector timestamp (VTS) in order to validate happens-before relationships between transitions.  An adjacency matrix is used to represent the happens-before relationships and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to add transitive happens-before relationships. Using lock-free programming, atomic operations are able to concurrently access memory without the use of locks. This influential standard must be considered when designing multithreaded applications.

      "Performance, effectiveness, and usefulness metrics were included in a user study in Computer Science at Virginia Tech to evaluate Willgrind and WillgrindPlus, comparing with Nullgrind and Helgrind – all four run under the Valgrind framework. Since the execution of threads in Valgrind is serialized, threads can be blocked for extended periods of time when waiting to run, causing performance degradation. To rectify this, the processor affinity of Valgrind should be set for all threads to run on a single core. The test suite for users is comprised of a medley of familiar divide-and-conquer algorithms and each algorithm is assessed with various sizes and thread counts. The results indicate that the overhead in Willgrind is primarily dominated by the Valgrind recompilation process. Since WillgrindPlus does not check for data-races, a performance improvement is possible by removing unnecessary vector clocks. Effectiveness evaluation to analyze the ability of Willgrind and WillgrindPlus to detect bugs was performed.  After analyzing the anonymous code evaluation, a majority of respondents believe the tool definitely helped them detect at least one bug in their code. Additionally, none of the respondents said the tool definitely did not help to catch a bug.  Overall, the survey indicated that the tool is important, useful, and credible to the students.\n",

Understanding wake flow is necessary for understanding the noise produced by a wake generator. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is used to determine the optimum velocity profile that describes the shape of structures in flow. Two-point correlation functions are used to infer the characteristic eddy structures in each wake using the proper orthogonal decomposition. Comparisons between cylinder structures and airfoil turbulent wake flows will give insight into how and why different inflow conditions produce different sound fields when an open rotor ingests wake flows.

      "The two-dimensionality of the cylinder wake was determined to be acceptable at both test locations and the normalized wakes were judged to be similar. More measurements were made in the open circuit wind tunnel thank the stability wind tunnel; these were followed by shifting the measurement grid data, correcting for the angle sensitivity of the hotwire probes, and studying hotwire probe coherence. The two-point time delay correlation depends on three spatial coordinates, so quad-hotwire probes were used to measure the three components of velocity in each flow. The full measurement campaign consisted of 19 independent measurements, where each measurement had a unique fixed probe position. Cylinder wake flow was shown to be substantially more turbulent than the airfoil wake flow, while supporting a very similar mean flow. The two-point correlations showed that structures in the cylinder wake remain coherent to longer time delays and probe separations than those present in the airfoil wake. This suggests that an open rotor ingesting the cylinder wake will produce a very different sound profile than a rotor ingesting an airfoil wake.\n",

      "T.S. Eliot’s poem ‘Burnt Norton and Reflected Light’ which originated from his 1934 visit to and old and burned manor house, explores temporal existence and the search for a meaning, sensed but not understood, outside the boundaries of human finitude, through the lens of motion, both linear and non-linear. Initially, the notion that the mind is capable of viewing time with perpetual possibilities is discussed - the idea of ‘what could have happened’. Then, ways to escape linear time after exile from the rose garden are illustrated, into the outside world that has been entrapped by time. The poem then descends into a different realm - using the analogy of an underground metro that is dimly lit and aims to create a contrast between the previously explored shadowy unreality of “time-ridden” lives. Further, the poem talks about returning back to the surface, but a black cloud carries the sun away.  The transience of words and music (which are also in motion) is also illustrated. Through a set of images, Eliot guides the reader into the beginning of a search for visions of reality’s light.\n",

      "T.S. Eliot’s second poem of the Four Quartets is ‘East Coker and the Dance’. While ‘Burnt Norton’ gives a glimpse outside the linear veneer of time, it presents the problem, of making time stretch before and after, seem to be a waste of time. This poem, East Coker, responds to the problem by delving into this expanse of time before and after, probing into the ridiculousness and seeming endlessness of human limitation in the face of such a moment of vision. It further questions whether existence in time negates the potential of meaningfulness. This question is explored using the image of a dance, which gracefully ties together the motion of time and the stillness of waiting into the search for meaning. Thus, what seems like an end, is a part of the dance, and therefore a beginning.\n",

      "T.S Eliot’s third poem from the Four Quartets is ‘The Dry Salvages and the Clanging Bell’. The previous poem 'East Coker' gives a response to humanity’s position within the ‘waste sad time,’ which leads to the vision of a dance that draws time and timelessness together into meaning. This poem presents a response to this problem on a larger scale. It develops the image of the sea that was illustrated at the end of East Coker more fully. Memories that were significant to Elliot are translated into an image of a sea of time that is incomprehensibly vast, empty, and endless. Similar to the previous poems, the intersection outside reality with the limited realm of humanity warrants the need for a response, the drive to “fare forward.” The reflected light and dance of the prior two poems, and the clang of the bell here, all are echoes of the Incarnation, pointing to deeper meaning in the midst of exile, darkness, and chaos.\n",

      "The last poem from the Four Quartets is ‘Little Gidding.’  It echoes many of the images and ideas found throughout the previous three poems. Within this final poem, Eliot is able to develop a way of approaching the problem of meaning that is both unique to Little Gidding and, at the same time, ties the whole of Four Quartets together in a sense of conclusion and finality. The image of “Pentecostal fire” appears near the very beginning of the poem, and it is in the descent of these divine flames into the human world that the other images are tied together and transformed. The response the poem enacts is both the same pattern, and the pattern made new, as the searching in exile of Burnt Norton, the waiting in the darkness of East Coker, or the faring forward on the sea of The Dry Salvage. Here it is a response of embracing renewal and transfiguration by means of fire. Thus, the language and vision of each of the four poems gives a different way to understand the search for deeper meaning, tied together in a journey of response that leads us back to the beginning to find we “know the place for the first time.”\n",

In this domain, Sen coined the term concolic execution (a portmanteau of concrete and symbolic) based on engaging classical symbolic execution over concrete execution paths from testing with concrete inputs. CORT (Concolic RTL Test Generator), a new test generation framework, was designed for rapid generation using a new methodology of systematically growing a new type of test decision tree (TDT) over short explorations of highly efficient cycle-by-cycle concolic execution. The novel methodology aids the automation of testing functional level hardware description with the aim of maximizing branch coverage. CORT’s advantages were demonstrated by generating high-branch coverage tests for the ITC99 and IWLS-2005 benchmarks. Further, its tests were smaller, and generation faster, than other approaches.\n",

      "Improving the validation of hardware design builds upon automated functional test generation, concolic execution, scaling through factored exploration, use of Verilator, and Register Transfer Level (RTL) instrumentation. Due to differences between Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and software languages, where many testing approaches have had good success, new approaches are needed for RTL test generation, such as hybrids of constraint-based and search-based techniques. Concolic execution explores a tree of possible execution paths and yields a concrete execution trace; tests are generated corresponding to the leaf nodes in the response tree. Scaling the concolic execution is aided by factoring the exploration into smaller tests and obtaining the initial values of signals through instrumentation, each time bringing the system away from the initial state. Measuring branch coverage is done automatically by Verilator, an open source transpiler (source-to-source compiler), which automatically instruments the source code. Related work includes HYBRO, an RTL directed test generator that symbolically executes the concrete trace extracted from the design Control Flow Graph (CFG), PACOST, that uses factored explorations, and BEACON, with dynamically calculated branch coverage based heuristics.\n",

      "Concolic execution on its own is hindered by the limitations of path explosion and computational eﬀort of evaluation over a large number of cycles. The entire Control Flow Graph (CFG) of the design is processed every cycle. Factoring the exploration into a smaller number of cycles and combining the results of each exploration oﬀers a promising avenue to scale the test generation. CORT (Concolic RTL Test Generator), employs a novel methodology for RTL directed test generation that aims to maximize branch coverage with a minimal number of test vectors, in the shortest amount of time. The test generation problem is treated as a task of iteratively building the global Test Decision Tree (TDT) for the design over each exploration. Key is the paradigm of the Test Decision Tree, along with its construction and interpretation. The CORT framework includes preprocessing, concolic execution engine, test generation, and systematic exploration. Evaluation through experimentation considers branch coverage and the effects of exploration length.\n",
